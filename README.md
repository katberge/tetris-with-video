# Tetris With Video

This is my first JavaScript project. I started by following freeCodeCamp's video on creating Tetris with Javascript (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw), and that laid most of the foundation. After finishing going along with the video, I had a much better understanding of how to use Javascript in context and was able to add features on my own.
